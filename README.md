# graduation-mark
This is a stupid code in italian. I'm learning to code in python and this is a really simple program to tell you the graduation mark (on 110/110 scale) based on your personal ideas. It was created just for personal use and it gives you maximum 7 points for the final discussion but....maybe someone will use it to learn something new.
